This is an extremely early BETA, don't expect it to be perfect please ðŸ™‚ Report crashes and non-working scripts to me.

**Features**:
```md
- Hydrogen is the **only** tool that has a native and Metal accelerated drawing library

- Fast updates
- Stable execution environment
```

Massive update!

Core changes:
- Implemented/fixed gethiddenproperty and sethiddenproperty to actually return hidden properties like BinaryString and SharedString
- Added firetouchinterest
- Implemented saveinstance, provided by `UniversalSynSaveInstance https://discord.gg/wx4ThpAsmw`. The documentation in Hydrogen for saveinstance is `saveinstance(config: {})` where the config is a table described by https://luau.github.io/UniversalSynSaveInstance/api/SynSaveInstance. If no config is passed, the default config is: `{ SafeMode = true, timeout = 15, SaveBytecode = true }`
- Fixed an annoying issue where teleports and game joins could cause a crash
- Fixed a bug that would cause the game to freeze on join
```
