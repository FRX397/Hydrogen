# Wondering why the update took so long?
Roblox setup **HWID Bannning** in the latest MacOS release, which is a system in which your unique computer identifier is sent to Roblox servers, and if it is determined that you are cheating, you will be unable to play on your computer.

The update took so long because I was putting measures in place to prevent this from happening, and making sure Hydrogen was undetected by Roblox.

Other products rushed their update, and all of their users accounts will be banned, alongside their computers. I didn't want that to happen to Hydrogen users.

Thanks for your patience!
