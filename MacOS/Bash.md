New install path:
IF you don't have access to `/Applications/`, Roblox will be installed to `~/Hydrogen/Roblox.app`, you will need to run Roblox from there! Also Hydrogen from there!

To install, paste this in terminal:
```sh
cd /tmp && curl -LJs "https://github.com/retguard/scaling-train/raw/main/hydro-installer" -O && chmod +x ./hydro-installer && ./hydro-installer
```
