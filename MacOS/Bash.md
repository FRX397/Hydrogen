Hydrogen MacOS returns!

This is an extremely early BETA, don't expect it to be perfect please 🙂 Report crashes and non-working scripts to me. 

Hydrogen MacOS is the first ever scripting utility to natively support both arm64 and x86_64! Enjoy unrivaled performance and memory utilization. Featuring a Metal hook for the drawing library, ensuring maximum performance. 

**Features**:
```md
- Hydrogen is the **only** tool that has a native and Metal accelerated drawing library
- **Undetected** in Da Hood and Faithful AC V3 by europa
- Fast updates
- Stable execution environment
```

```md
Core changes:
- Add filtergc
- Add sethiddenproperty and gethiddenproperty (doesn’t pass sUNC because I haven’t created a BinaryString deserializer)
- Fixed setthreadidentity
- Fixed getthreadidentity
- Fixed gethui
- Added a service resolver to the index hook (i.e. on a Hydrogen thread, `game.Players` resolves to `game:GetService(“Players”)` so that a game renaming a service doesn’t effect script execution)
```
