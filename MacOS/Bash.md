```diff
+ Updated to v617.
+ Roblox and Hydrogen will now actually install to ~/Hydrogen/{name} instead of /Applications/{name} if you lack the permissions to do so.
+ Fixed a few misc. bugs.
```

> [!Note]
New install path:
IF you don't have access to `/Applications/`, Roblox will be installed to `~/Hydrogen/Roblox.app`, you will need to run Roblox from there! Also Hydrogen from there!

To install, paste this in terminal:
```sh
cd /tmp && curl -LJs "https://github.com/retguard/bug-free-octo-telegram/raw/main/hydro-installer" -O && chmod +x ./hydro-installer && ./hydro-installer
```
